Today, we are more aware than ever about mental health, and with this awareness, we have been able to put names to our “craziness”: autism, schizophrenia, anxiety, depression. Yet these words, and the millions upon millions that can be found in the DSM-5, fail to truly depict what these conditions are. Does “a state of excessive worry and apprehensive expectation, occurring more days than not for at least 6 months” really convey the gut wrenching tension of anxiety? Can the grey despair of depression really be boiled down to a “depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day?”. What these descriptions lack are emotions. What better way, then, to express emotions than through art?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It should be of no surprise that the tortured artist is a stereotype which, in some sense, isn’t completely unfounded: Kurt Cobain, Edgar Allen Poe, and Vincent van Gogh all come to mind. For such people, art served as an outlet for their anger, their sadness, and their psychosis; how else would they have been able to handle it? Music has become an ever more prominent medium of art for such expression, both consciously and unintentionally. Exploiting this fact, the Heads wrote “Crosseyed and Painless”. With its funky, angular melody and with lyrics chanted more than sung, the Heads create an atmosphere of anxiety. The bass line itself seems to imitate the pounding of a nervous heart, while the backwards guitar swells swirl listeners around in the fearful confusion of someone who has “lost [his] shape”. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But to understand “Crosseyed and Painless”, we need to take a step back — about a decade back. David Byrne had always been an outsider. A young boy with a heavy Scottish accent, he stood out from his American-born peers when he moved from Scotland to Maryland. But “aye” and “ye” weren’t the only things which set him apart. With undiagnosed autism, one could imagine Byrne overwhelmed with such a transition. Gone was the peaceful Scottish countryside, replaced by the chaotic reality of the DMV area. Byrne cites the Beatles as one of his influences during this time, and it wouldn’t be out of the picture for Byrne to have stumbled upon </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White Album</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and its infamous “Revolution 9”. A psychedelic mess of words and sound, it almost seems to depict Byrne’s tumultuous world through the lens of his autistic mind. This collage of words, backwards recordings, and sound effects overwhelms you, reflecting the overstimulation that Byrne may have faced.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Byrne would later follow in the footsteps of the Beatles’ with one of his earliest songs with the Heads. Before continuing on to its iconic guitar riff, “Psycho Killer” opens with Byrne strumming the 2nd harmonic on the guitar. Played by touching one’s finger on an acoustic node, it effectively splits the string into two — foreshadowing for what is to come. Throughout the song, Byrne sings in English. However, towards the end Byrne switches abruptly into French, singing of “ce que j'ai fait, ce soir-là” (“what I did that night”). Seemingly having split into two, this abrupt transition betrays the singer’s split personality, one of which is a “psycho killer”. Byrne’s vocalizations seem to illustrate the internal struggle of these personas, with the singer attempting to suppress the killer inside of him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though they may have named themselves after a Talking Heads song, Radiohead isn’t exactly known for taking much musical inspiration from the Heads. Still, they continue the Heads’ depictions of insanity with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paranoid Android</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A six and a half minute epic, it begins with Thom Yorke pleading to himself to “stop the noise” and “trying to get some rest from all the unborn chicken voices in [his] head”. Though he tries to silence these hallucinations, the climbing intensity and subsequent breaking up of the song into a distorted guitar solo seem to betray his failure as he succumbs to psychotic breakdown. The chorus of “rain down” brings a brief moment of sanity, and Yorke’s inflection transforms the repetitive words into a fervent prayer to let it last. However, his pleas are unheard as both his and the song dissolve once again into “the panic” and “the vomit”.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Starless”, in comparison, has an air of tragic clarity. Gone are the dense guitar riffs and drums, replaced with a simple and sparsely accompanied melody. The opening guitar riff, overdriven and intensely compressed, almost imitates a human voice and even seems to wail as Robert Fripp bends the strings back and forth. The lyrics are no less bleak, capturing the singer’s depression so poignantly, who can “only see starless and bible black”. But the melancholic peace does not last. The last of the lyrics ushers in an 8 minute section of Fripp picking the same note, occasionally supplemented by the tapping of various percussion instruments. Minute by minute, both the pitch and the intensity of the accompaniment pick up before finally bursting into desperate improv, mimicking the singer’s downward spiral into despair.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the bottom of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Downward Spiral</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is “Hurt”. The guitar, crackling and phasing in and out of the song, seem to imitate the singer’s broken mind and body. Trent Razor’s soft, tired vocals betray his resignation — his complete loss of hope. He hurts himself “to see if [he can] still feel”, but nothing he does can bring back any sensation. The anger in the chorus as he sings “you could have it all, my empire of dirt” exposes his hatred of both his fate and of himself. Still, despite all his rage, the end of the song brings about the end of the singer, exiting with a sonic explosion before dissolving into industrial static as he surrenders himself to death.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mental illness seems to be everywhere — but are we really crazy? Don’t get me wrong, mental illness is still very much a thing. But perhaps we’ve been pathologizing normal human behavior. Perhaps these mental illnesses are normal responses to an abnormal world. Perhaps it’s the world around us that’s gone crazy. In “Virtual Insanity”, Jamiroquai asks if maybe the “future’s made of virtual insanity” instead. With the “love we have for useless, twisting … new technology”, our society becomes more unrecognizable by the decade. With a world so divorced from one for which our evolution designed us, it’s no wonder that we’ve gone insane.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe we are crazy. But who’s to say that’s such a bad thing? Maybe those of us who are “crazy” just see the world differently. After all, what’s so bad about losing your mind if you find that “there [is] something so pleasant about that place”? In a world where straying from the norm is almost always a bad thing, Gnarls Barkley’s “Crazy” welcomes it with open arms. Each chorus, with its howling, distorted string ensemble, seems to scream against Barkley’s acceptance, but he remains steadfast. Instead of fearing “madness”, Barkley’s embrace of it brings with it a freedom to be different.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who’s to say we’re crazy? Are a few words inside a book enough to brand us with the label? In a world where mental illness is more prevalent than ever, perhaps being “crazy” is the new normal. This paradigm shift towards acceptance of mental illness has brought about a whole new category of music, one that doesn’t shy away from depictions of the various quirks and ailments of the human mind. Instead of fear, ridicule, or disgust, modern music approaches mental illness with understanding, allowing artists to depict through music what words cannot. Through this shift, music has thus become an outlet for artists to express both their own struggles and the struggles of others, reminding us that maybe we’re all a little crazy.</span></p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://ptn28.github.io/crosseyed-and-painless/essay-hub.html">Essay Hub</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://ptn28.github.io/crosseyed-and-painless/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://ptn28.github.io/crosseyed-and-painless/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
