The flagship of this sonic attack was “Crosseyed and Painless,” a disjointed tune accompanied by similarly incoherent lyrics. The song was far from a popular success, yet through its unconventional composition, it achieves a level of complexity that more traditional songs fail to achieve. My website demonstrates how “Crosseyed and Painless” represents the fracture of identity and paints a rich portrait of the benefits and consequences that entail.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central to the creation of the song is lead singer David Byrne, who is often synonymous with the Talking Heads themselves. Byrne is a notoriously eccentric figure, a fact which is deeply ingrained in the art he produces (Sella 2001). Defying categorization, Bryne draws from a mosaic of influences in his work, ranging from Latin samba to Americana. “Crosseyed and Painless” is no different. The erratic melody and rhythm draw upon the influence of Afrobeats artist Fela Kuti. The bizarre lyrics trace their origins back to producer Brian Eno’s Oblique Strategies, a deck of cards with mystic commands that the Heads utilized to disrupt conventional songwriting (Tune Tempest n.d.).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The song itself depicts the breakdown of identity, both individually and societally, and the lyrics convey the crumbling ego of the singer, anxious to cobble together what little remains. The Heads had conceived of the song at the turn of the ‘80s, a decade hallmarked by artifice and the disintegration of identity (Brooks 2018). Lines between genders and sexualities were blurred with the rise of androgyny, spearheaded by artists like Duran Duran (Peters 2016). The definition of genres became hazy with the growth of new wave, with genric labels losing meaning in the face of intense musical cross-pollination (Kronengold 2008). Even the separation between seemingly incompatible peoples softened as artists from both the US and African dared to cultural borders (Currin 2018). </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Crosseyed and Painless” deliberately depicts the consequences of this collapse. Written in the midst of societal upheaval and the hottest moments of the Cold War, public fear and paranoia were at a flashpoint (Williams 2020). The song is thus painfully aware of the mental troubles which these tumultuous times created and exacerbated. My page “Facts Are Never What They Seem to Be” considers Michael Brog’s examination of “Crosseyed and Painless” through a psychoanalytical lens. Brog considers each song in the wider album, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remain in Light</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and interprets both the lyrics and the instrumentation of the songs as descriptive of various mental ailments, ranging from paranoid schizophrenia to multiple personality disorder. Using the album as a case study, Brog argues that contemporary music has been an unjustly neglected subject of psychoanalytical study (2002). Exploring “Crosseyed and Painless,” he considers it indicative of the singer’s psychosis induced by his loss of identity, drawing upon the foundational theories of Sigmund Freud and Wilfred Bion to explain how the singer’s psychotic breakdown leads to the antagonistic relationship with facts portrayed by the song (Brog 2002).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My page “Music Turned Inside Out” delves further into this aspect of “Crosseyed and Painless.” Composed of seven songs depicting various forms of mental illness, it frames “Crosseyed and Painless” as a prime representation of the broken human psyche within music and considers similar examples in the music of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. As Brog argued, rich depictions of mental illness can be found in contemporary music, a field where the stereotype of the tortured artist is not too divorced from reality. Delving into the playlist, Radiohead paints a vivid picture of schizophrenia through their magnum opus, “Paranoid Android”, while the bleak singing of Trent Reznor almost seems to instill within listeners the depression he depicts in “Hurt”.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Though the song divulges all the harms stemming from the fracture of identity, the Heads’ live performance of “Crosseyed and Painless” paradoxically promotes cohesion. Most famously, the Heads would go on to perform “Crosseyed and Painless” in their famous Stop Making Sense tour, which was recorded in the eponymous concert film (Demme 1984). Within my page “Night of the Living Heads”, I examine how the Heads’ use of the song in a live context contrasted with that of the studio version. While the lyrics of “Crosseyed and Painless” depict division, the Heads’ use the song in their live concert to bring disparate cultural and racial communities together (Gould 2023). Other artists have adopted “Crosseyed and Painless” for the same purpose, as the song is now a staple of the jam band scene, one which is characterized by a strong communal aspect (Zerbo 2023). In an age where identity only serves to divide, perhaps it is only through the dissolution of identity depicted through “Crosseyed and Painless” that unity can once again be found.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By embracing the loss of identity, the Heads were able to reach across not only cultural and racial boundaries, but musical boundaries as well. My page “Talking Back” looks upon the legacy of “Crosseyed and Painless” through various its covers and the songs it inspired. Though the Heads were far from mainstream, their impact on contemporary music cannot be understated. With acts ranging from jam bands like Phish, to African artists such as Angelique Kidjo, to more famous bands such as Radiohead, the musical impact of “Crosseyed and Painless” only seems to grow even as the popularity of the original artists wanes. Through their deliberate rejection of a singular identity, the Heads are able to influence a diverse range of artists which would have otherwise been unresponsive to a more rigid song.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, “Crosseyed and Painless” was never a commercial success. It never broke into the Billboard’s top 10, nor did it ever reach platinum certification. Nonetheless, my website demonstrates that, through its rich depiction of the loss of identity, a phenomenon that has only intensified since its inception, the messages of Crosseyed and Painless can guide us through how to navigate the turbulent, ever-changing world we face today.</span></p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://ptn28.github.io/crosseyed-and-painless/essay-hub.html">Lose Your Shape</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://ptn28.github.io/crosseyed-and-painless/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://ptn28.github.io/crosseyed-and-painless/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
