The flagship of this sonic attack was the song “Crosseyed and Painless,” a disjointed tune accompanied by similarly incoherent lyrics. The song was far from a popular success, yet through its unconventional composition, it achieves a level of nuance and complexity that more traditional songs fail to achieve through both its musical and lyrical elements. My project demonstrates how “Crosseyed and Painless” represents the fracture of identity and paints a rich portrait of the consequences that entail.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central to the creation of the song is David Byrne. As the lead singer of the Talking Heads, he is often synonymous with the band itself. Byrne is a notoriously eccentric figure, a fact which is deeply ingrained in the art he produces (Sella 2001). Defying categorization, Bryne draws from a mosaic of influences in his work, ranging from Latin samba to Americana. “Crosseyed and Painless” is no different. The erratic melody and rhythm draw upon the influence of Afrobeats artist Fela Kuti, while the bizarre lyrics trace their origins back to producer Brian Eno’s Oblique Strategies, a deck of cards containing mystic commands that the Heads utilized to disrupt their conventional songwriting.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The song itself depicts the breakdown of identity, both individually and societally, and the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lyrics convey the crumbling ego of the singer, anxious to cobble together what little remains. The Heads had conceived of the song at the turn of the 80s, a decade hallmarked by artifice (Brooks 2018). The hippies and punks, who once attached their identity to authenticity, grew up to become yuppies, putting aside old principles to climb the corporate ladder at any cost. What followed was a disintegration of identity, with lines between genders (Peters 2016), genres (Kronengold 2008), and culture blurred (Currin 2018). Throughout my project, I examine both the causes and effects of this breakdown, demonstrating how “Crosseyed and Painless” deliberately depicts and was created as a result of this collapse.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Facts Are Never What They Seem to Be” considers Michael Brog’s examination of “Crosseyed and Painless”, which looks at the song through a psychoanalytical lens. Written during the height of the Cold War when public fear and paranoia were at a flashpoint (Williams 2020), the song is painfully aware of the mental troubles which many suffered and which the tumultuous times exacerbated. Brog considers each song in the wider album, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remain in Light</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and interprets both the lyrics and the instrumentation of the songs as descriptive of various mental ailments, ranging from paranoid schizophrenia to multiple personality disorder. Using the album as a case study, Brog argues that contemporary music has been an unjustly neglected subject of psychoanalytical study (2002). Exploring “Crosseyed and Painless,” he considers it indicative of the singer’s psychosis induced by his loss of identity, drawing upon the foundational theories of Sigmund Freud and Wilfred Bion to explain how the singer’s psychotic breakdown leads to his antagonistic relationship with facts portrayed by the song (Brog 2002).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Music Turned Inside Out” delves further into this aspect of “Crosseyed and Painless.” Composed of seven songs depicting various forms of mental illness, it frames “Crosseyed and Painless” as a prime representation of the broken human psyche within music and considers similar examples in the music of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. As Brog argued, rich depictions of mental illness can be found in contemporary music, a field where the stereotype of the tortured artist is not too divorced from reality. Delving into the playlist, Radiohead paints a vivid picture of schizophrenia through their magnum opus, “Paranoid Android”, while the bleak singing of Trent Reznor almost seems to instill within listeners the depression he depicts in “Hurt”.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Heads would go on to perform “Crosseyed and Painless” in their famous Stop </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making Sense tour, which was recorded in the eponymous concert film (Demme 1984). Within “Night of the Living Heads”, I examine how the Heads’ use of the song in a live context contrasted with that of the studio version. Though the song is representative of fracture and dissolution, the Heads’ live performance of “Crosseyed and Painless” paradoxically promotes community and cohesion. Other artists have exploited this fact, as the song is now a staple of the jam band scene, one which is characterized by its strong community. In an age where identity only serves to divide, perhaps it is only through the dissolution of identity depicted through “Crosseyed and Painless” that unity can once again be found.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Talking Back” looks upon the legacy of “Crosseyed and Painless” through various covers and songs which take inspiration from it. Though the Heads were far from mainstream, their impact on contemporary music cannot be understated. With acts ranging from jam bands like Phish, to African artists such as Angelique Kidjo, to more famous bands such as Radiohead, the influence of “Crosseyed and Painless” only seems to grow even as the popularity of the original artists who first conceived of it wanes. Through their deliberate rejection of a singular identity, the Heads are able to reach a diverse range of artists which would have otherwise been unresponsive to a more rigid song.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, “Crosseyed and Painless” was never a commercial success. It never broke </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">into the Billboard’s top 10, nor did it ever reach platinum certification. Nonetheless, my project </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">demonstrates that, through its rich depiction of the loss of identity, a phenomenon that has only </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">intensified since its inception, the messages of Crosseyed and Painless can guide us through how to navigate the turbulent, ever-changing world we face today.</span></p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://ptn28.github.io/crosseyed-and-painless/essay-hub.html">Essay Hub</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://ptn28.github.io/crosseyed-and-painless/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://ptn28.github.io/crosseyed-and-painless/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
