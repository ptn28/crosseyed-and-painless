The song would become a staple in their live concert repertoire, eventually being performed at their famous </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stop Making Sense </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tour at the Hollywood Pantages Theatre in 1983 and recorded for the eponymous concert film. This performance of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crosseyed and Painless</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would be the last one of their tour, an ecstatic coup de grace for an already lively series of performances. Yet, once you look beyond its polyrhythms and Afrobeat funk, this performance becomes more than just a musical capstone. It is the culmination of the ‘80s. It is the pinnacle of a decade governed by the shattering of old values and communities, characterized by the overturning of the cultural and social status quo. Nonetheless, by picking up the pieces, the Heads create a mosaicked sense of community through </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crosseyed and Painless</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, layered beneath layers of artifice but still no less real. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the beginning of their performance, the Heads knock you off your feet. Although it starts off rather sedately with a calm keyboard and guitar melody, the Heads promptly ramp up the intensity as the tempo quickens and the guitar dissolves into distorted screeching. The only thing left for your ears to hold on to is the frantic cowbell, and even then it struggles to stay afloat amidst a roiling ocean of clashing percussion instruments. Once you’ve already fallen down, the Heads make sure you are not going to be getting back up. As David Byrne enters the scene, he begins chanting “lost my shape, trying to act casual.” As Byrne continues, he “[lifts his] head, looking for the danger signs,” planting the seed of fear and paranoia within your mind which he further incubates with his wild swings in pitch. These anxious lyrics, along with Byrne’s panicked, feral delivery, make sure that any balance — whether mental or musical — has completely disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It isn’t hard to see why fans continue to rave about this sonic whirlwind of a performance. Its resurrection through the re-release of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stop Making</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sense</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> concert film, four decades after its original debut, should be evidence enough as to its musical merits. Yet fully appreciating the song will require you to go all the way back to a time before its inception. Though the Heads were born out of the "larger punk scene … predicated on rejecting the artifice of late-’70s rock”, they were very much living in an age of artifice (Brooks 2018). Rising to popularity at the dawn of the 80s, the Heads walked onto the scene during a decade characterized by “a tremendous emphasis on surface appearances” (UCSD 2002). Gone were the hippies and the punks, who built their lives around authenticity and rawness. In were the yuppies, whose culture was hallmarked by special effects and groomed corporate outfits. Accordingly, the music produced by the Heads’ music was also overtly artificial: you can guess what sort of vibes an album named </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">More Songs About Buildings and Food</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> might give off. Their performance of “Crosseyed and Painless” is no less synthetic. White, middle-class art students from Rhode Island, playing alongside a company of black funk musicians, perform a song from an Afrobeats-inspired album to an audience of former hippies and current Hollywood elites. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet despite, or perhaps because of, this “continual overlaying of artifices,” the Heads create a genuine sense of community through “Crosseyed and Painless”</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Brooks 2018). The song takes inspiration from work of Afrobeats artist Fela Kuti, his own music drawing from traditional Yoruba music, a genre where making music literally takes a village. Indeed, the whole creative process behind this performance took a village — now proverbial — which crossed national, racial, and social lines. The explicit inclusion and visible contributions of these historically overlooked racial and ethnic groups within their performance emphasize that anyone, and everyone, is allowed to enjoy it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long after the demise of the Talking Heads, the community aspects of  “Crosseyed and Painless” are still appreciated through more contemporary live performances of the song. David Byrne remarks that “‘even though the music didn’t always sound particularly African, it shared that ecstatic communal feeling’” (Ferrier 2022). Jam bands such as Phish, recognizing this quality in “Crosseyed and Painless”, have incorporated the song into their repertoire, which is now a staple at their show. Jam bands differ from other acts in that they cannot be fully enjoyed (or sometimes enjoyed at all) through recordings. Their playing trails off into lengthy sections of improvisation verging on noise, and most listeners would tear off their headphones listening at home. Yet, their paradoxical popularity arises from a strong communal spirit present at their live concerts, a spirit which harkens back to the Heads’ concert at Pantage Theaters and is kindled with every performance of  “Crosseyed and Painless”. Indeed, at a festival packed with exhausted (and definitely inebriated) fans, few songs invite concertgoers to dissolve into the collective energy of the crowd like the frantic groove of “Crosseyed and Painless”.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facts are simple. Facts are straight. Yet the fact of the matter is that “Crosseyed and Painless” is more than just a song. It is an artifact of an era defined by cultural fragmentation and the loss of authenticity. Yet, rather than rejecting it, the song revels in the artifice and creates a sense of community which is strangely sincere. In a world which continues to grow more confused and disconnected, “Crosseyed and Painless” invites us to embrace disorder and forge our own communities through the chaos.</span></p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://ptn28.github.io/crosseyed-and-painless/essay-hub.html">Lose Your Shape</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://ptn28.github.io/crosseyed-and-painless/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://ptn28.github.io/crosseyed-and-painless/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
