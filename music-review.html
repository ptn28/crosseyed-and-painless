The song would become a staple in their live concert repertoire, eventually being performed at their famous </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stop Making Sense </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">performances at the Hollywood Pantages Theatre in 1983. This performance of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crosseyed and Painless</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would be the last one of their tour, an ecstatic coup de grace for an already lively series of performances.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the very beginning of the performance, the Heads seem to want to knock their audience off their feet. It all begins rather sedately with a funky keyboard and guitar melody, though the Heads quickly ramp up the intensity as the tempo quickens and the guitar dissolves into distorted screeching. The only thing that your ears could even try to hold on to is the cowbell, and even then it is still struggling to stay afloat amidst a roiling ocean of clashing percussion instruments. Once you’ve already fallen down, the Heads make sure you’re not going to get back up. As David Byrne enters the scene, he begins chanting “lost my shape, trying to act casual”. As Byrne continues, he paints a picture of fear and paranoia while he “[lifts his] head, looking for the danger signs”. These anxious lyrics, along with Byrne’s panicked, rhythmic delivery, make sure that any balance — whether mental or musical — has completely disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This sonic whirlwind is truly befitting of the original name of the studio album from which it is descends: “Melody Attack”. The confusion expressed by the song’s music and lyrics can perhaps be seen as reflecting the loss of self in society of the time. Though the Heads were born out of the "larger punk scene … predicated on rejecting the artifice of late-’70s rock”, they were very much living in an age of artifice (Brooks 2018). Written at the dawn of the 80s, the song was born into a decade characterized by “a tremendous emphasis on surface appearances”, hallmarked by the yuppy, special effects, and MTV (UCSD 2002). Accordingly, the music produced by the Heads’ music was also overtly artificial; you can guess what sort of vibes an album named “More Songs About Buildings and Food” might give off. This performance of “Crosseyed and Painless” is no less synthetic: a song from an Afrobeats-inspired album, performed by white, middle-class art students from Rhode Island alongside black funk musicians to an audience of hippies and Hollywood elites. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet despite, or perhaps because of, this “continual overlaying of artifices”, the Heads create a genuine sense of community through </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crosseyed and Painless </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Brooks 2018). </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remain In Light</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was influenced by the Afrobeats artist Fela Kuti, his own music drawing from traditional Yoruba music, a genre where making music literally takes a village. Indeed, the whole creative process behind this performance took a (now proverbial) village which crossed national, racial, and social lines. Though the music may not be for everyone, the influence and inclusion of international and historically marginalized groups within their performance emphasizes that anyone is allowed to enjoy it. This is far removed from the punk movement which preceded them: stripped down and authentic, perhaps, but restricted to a very white audience. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The community nature of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crosseyed and Painless</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is further highlighted in its performance at live concerts, with Byrne himself remarking that “‘even though the music didn’t always sound particularly African, it shared that ecstatic communal feeling’” (Ferrier 2022). Jam bands such as Phish have recognized this quality in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crosseyed and Painless</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has become a staple in their show. Jam band music is fundamentally different to studio music in that it cannot be fully enjoyed (or sometimes enjoyed at all) outside of a live performance, as songs will often trail off into lengthy sections of improvisation before melting into noise. You’d probably tear off your headphones in boredom listening at home, but consider the song in the context of the wider concert experience. With fans, exhausted from their travels and probably in an altered state of mind, it's not hard to see how concertgoers would dissolve into the collective energy of the entire audience amidst the frantic groove of the song. In a community where connection and shared experience is central to concerts, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crosseyed and Painless</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offers the perfect answer on how to achieve it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facts are simple. Facts are straight. Yet the fact of the matter is that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crosseyed and Painless</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is more than just a song. It is a reflection of a decade governed by the shattering of old values and communities. Yet, by picking up the pieces, the Heads create a mosaicked sense community through </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crosseyed and Painless</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, layered beneath layers of artifice but still no less real. </span></p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://ptn28.github.io/crosseyed-and-painless/essay-hub.html">Essay Hub</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://ptn28.github.io/crosseyed-and-painless/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://ptn28.github.io/crosseyed-and-painless/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
