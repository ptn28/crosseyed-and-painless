Embracing influence from Afrobeat icon Fela Kuti, the jagged tunes of the album were far divorced from the corporate, soulless rock which had dominated pop music for the past decade. Because of its nonconformity, it would never see the same success as the more conventional albums it sought to overthrow. Still, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remain In Light</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would go on to influence many musical figures, and one of its songs in particular, “Crosseyed and Painless,” has inspired artists across genres. Though it was first conceived of over nearly half a century ago, “Crosseyed and Painless” has continued to impact music throughout the decades that followed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most obvious example of the impact of “Crosseyed and Painless” is through its covers. The most prevalent example of covering is by jam bands, where many of the biggest names in the scene have adopted the song for regular performance. Phish is the trailblazer for this trend. Having first covered the entirety of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remain In Light</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during their Halloween show in 1996, “Crosseyed and Painless” would endure and become a staple in their repertoire in the years that followed (Phish.net n.d.). Goose, following in the footsteps of Phish, would also begin performing “Crosseyed and Painless” themselves in 2016, playing it 41 times over the course of 6 years (El Goose n.d.). Though the funky melodies of “Crosseyed and Painless” are perfect for producing the disorienting atmosphere of a jam band concert, they also act as creative springboards for the lengthy jams which follow. One such example of the song’s flexibility can be seen during Phish’s famous Big Cypress festival, performed on the New Year’s Eve of 1999. Phish would transition from a fairly faithful recreation of “Crosseyed and Painless” into an expansive 15-minute jam. The anxious tone of the original melody gave way to a victorious celebration of humankind as Phish jammed out the song to usher in the new millennium. Even as a song so fraught with fear that psychoanalysts have found it worthy for study, “Crosseyed and Painless” nonetheless remains a versatile tune which can shapeshift into any number of forms under the persuasion of jam bands like Phish.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the various artists that have covered “Crosseyed and Painless” over the years, one in particular stands as an outlier: Angelique Kidjo. With their lengthy improvisational jams, Phish’s and Goose’s covers can be seen as evolutions of the original song. However, as an African artist hailing from Benin, Kidjo’s rendition of “Crosseyed and Painless” in her cover album of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remain In Light</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> represents a return towards the Yoruba roots of the Afrobeat which inspired the song in the first place. The Heads have faced accusations of cultural appropriation for drawing such inspiration, but Kidjo squarely rebukes such charges, declaring that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remain In Light</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “‘is African!’” (Currin 2018). Her cover of “Crosseyed and Painless” fully embraces this opinion, adding polyrhythmic drumming from traditional Yoruba percussion and layering lyrics in her native Yoruba. Kidjo’s cover also carries a new interpretation of the song’s themes and lyrics. Whereas many analyze the songs of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remain In Light</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their Dada absurdity, Kidjo identifies the lyrics with her own experiences living under a Beninese dictatorship with a “war against democracy and a war against people’s rights.” Her reimagining of “Crosseyed and Painless”, straying from the original narrative of alienation in the Heads’ version, asks “where is the truth?” in a society whose media holds an unjustly “negative perception of Africa” (Currin 2018; Grow 2018).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radiohead, on the other hand, has never covered “Crosseyed and Painless” — or any Talking Heads song for that matter — yet they are the ones most impacted by the Heads. Radiohead derived its name from the eponymous Heads song, which may seem like a tribute at first glance. However, once you listen to the song, you’ll find that it’s a saccharine pop tune which was clearly cobbled together during the Heads’ creative death throes. Radiohead’s allusion feels like a mockery, if anything. Nonetheless, Radiohead held a great respect for the Talking Heads, with lead singer Thom Yorke remarking that the band was “heavily obsessed by ‘Remain In Light’” (Yorke 2014). The influence of “Crosseyed and Painless” shines through in many of their songs, especially towards the latter half of Radiohead’s career. One of the more obvious examples is “Bangers + Mash”, released on their album </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Rainbows Disk 2</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Heads’ influence is evident when comparing the openings of both songs, which utilize funky, angular guitar riffs sharply accented by the percussion. More subtle yet even more reliant on “Crosseyed and Painless,” is “Morning Mr. Magpie" from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The King of Limbs</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The repetitive staccato notes echo those of “Crosseyed and Painless,” and many of the percussive quirks, such as polyrhythms and syncopation, draw from the same Afrobeat style of drumming which inspired “Crosseyed and Painless.” Furthermore, the track made heavy use of taping, utilizing it to repeat musical motifs and create multiple layers of instrumentation, mirroring the Heads’ use of taping in “Crosseyed and Painless”.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond purely musical similarities, Radiohead also drew inspiration from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remain In Light</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in one of their most critically acclaimed albums, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kid A</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Yorke remarks that the band, following the completion of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK Computer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, found themselves drawn towards the unique range of “emotions that go with [</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remain In Light</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">]” (Yorke 2014). With this in mind, the neuroses of “Crosseyed and Painless” shine through in various songs throughout </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kid A</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, particularly in “In Limbo”. Just as David Byrne has “lost [his] shape” in “Crosseyed and Painless”, Yorke has “lost [his] way”, and his repetition of “another message I can’t read” mirrors Byrne's inability to understand facts in the Heads’ song.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the Talking Heads are far from being in vogue. Their last album, released almost three decades ago, was both a critical and commercial flop. Nonetheless, their contributions to music live on, particularly through “Crosseyed and Painless”. The song’s legacy, through both its covers and the inspiration it provides for other bands, can still be seen today.</span></p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://ptn28.github.io/crosseyed-and-painless/essay-hub.html">Lose Your Shape</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://ptn28.github.io/crosseyed-and-painless/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://ptn28.github.io/crosseyed-and-painless/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
