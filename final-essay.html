Embracing influence from the Afrobeat icon Fela Kuti, the jagged tunes of the album were far divorced from the often corporate, soulless rock which had dominated pop music. Perhaps because of its nonconformity, it would never see the same success as the more conventional albums it sought to overthrow. Still, it would go on to influence many musical figures, and one song in particular, “Crosseyed and Painless”, has managed to inspire artists across genres. Though it was first conceived of over nearly half a century ago, “Crosseyed and Painless” has impacted and continues to impact music throughout the decades that followed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the most prevalent covers of “Crosseyed and Painless” have been by jam bands, particularly by Phish. Having first covered the entirety of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remain In Light</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during their Halloween show in 1996, the song would endure and become a staple in their repertoire in the years that followed (Phish.net n.d.). Goose, following in the footsteps of Phish, would also begin performing “Crosseyed and Painless” themselves in 2016, playing it 41 times over the course of 6 years (El Goose n.d.). Though the funky melodies of “Crosseyed and Painless” are perfect for producing the disorienting atmosphere typical of a live jam band concert, they also act as the perfect creative springboards for the lengthy jams which follow. One such example of the song’s flexibility can be seen during Phish’s famous Big Cypress festival, performed on the New Year’s Eve of 1999. Phish would transition from a fairly faithful recreation of “Crosseyed and Painless” into an expansive 15-minute jam. The anxious tone gave way to a victorious celebration of humankind as Phish jammed out the song as they prepared to usher in the new millennium. Even with a song so fraught with fear that it has been studied by psychoanalysts, “Crosseyed and Painless” nonetheless remains a versatile tune which can shapeshift into any number of forms under the guidance of jam bands like Phish.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the various artists which have covered the Talking Heads over the years, one in particular stands as an outlier: Angelique Kidjo. The Heads’ music comes full circle through Kidjo’s cover album of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remain In Light</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As an African artist hailing from Benin, Kidjo’s cover represents a return of “Crosseyed and Painless” towards the Yoruba roots of the Afrobeat which inspired it in the first place. The Heads had faced accusations of cultural appropriation for drawing such inspiration, but Kidjo squarely rebukes such charges, declaring upon listening to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remain In Light</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that “‘this is African!’” (Currin 2018). Her cover of “Crosseyed and Painless” fully embraces this attitude, adding polyrhythmic drumming from traditional Yoruba percussion instruments and layering lyrics in her native Yoruba. Kidjo’s cover also brings with it a new interpretation of the song’s themes and lyrics. Whereas many analyze the songs of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remain In Light</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their Dada absurdity, Kidjo identifies her own experiences living under a Beninese dictatorship with a “war against democracy and a war against people’s rights” portrayed by their lyrics. Her rendition of “Crosseyed and Painless” thus veers away from an interpretation connecting it to social alienation in favor of one which asks “where is the truth?” in a society whose media holds an unjustly “negative perception of Africa” (Currin 2018; Grow 2018).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Radiohead has never covered “Crosseyed and Painless” — or any Talking Heads song for that matter — they are perhaps the ones most deeply influenced by the Heads. Radiohead derived their name from the eponymous Heads, which might look like a tribute at first glance, but once you take a listen to the song it is clear that that was not their intention. It’s a quite saccharine pop tune which was clearly cobbled together during the Heads’ creative death throes, and Radiohead’s choice is more of a mockery of the song, if anything. Nonetheless, Radiohead held a great respect for the Talking Heads, with lead singer Thom Yorke remarking that the band had been “heavily obsessed by ‘Remain In Light’” (Yorke 2014). The influence of “Crosseyed and Painless” shines through in many of their songs, especially towards the latter half of Radiohead’s career. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the more obvious examples is “Bangers + Mash”, released on their album </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Rainbows Disk 2</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Radiohead’s inspiration can be seen pretty clearly when comparing the openings of both songs, which utilize funky, angular guitar riffs sharply accented by the percussion. A little more subtle, but perhaps even more heavily reliant on “Crosseyed and Painless,” is “Morning Mr. Magpie" from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The King of Limbs</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The repetitive staccato notes echo those of “Crosseyed and Painless,” and many of the percussive quirks found throughout, such as polyrhythms and syncopation, draw from the same Afrobeat style of drumming which inspired “Crosseyed and Painless”. Furthermore, the track made heavy use of taping during its creation, mirroring the Heads’ use of it during the production of “Crosseyed and Painless”.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond similarities between their purely musical elements, Radiohead also drew inspiration from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remain In Light</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in one of their most critically acclaimed albums, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kid A</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Yorke remarks that the band, following the completion of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK Computer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, found themselves drawn towards the unique range of “emotions that go with [the] record” (Yorke 2014). With this source of inspiration in mind, the neuroses of “Crosseyed and Painless” shine through in various songs throughout </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kid A</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, particularly in “In Limbo”. Just as David Byrne has “lost [his] shape” in “Crosseyed and Painless”, Yorke has “lost [his] way”, and his repetition of “another message I can’t read” mirrors Byrne's inability to understand facts in the Heads’ song.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the Talking Heads are far from being in vogue. Their last album was released almost three decades ago, but even then it was both a critical and commercial flop. Nonetheless, their contributions to music, particularly “Crosseyed and Painless”, live on. Its legacy, through the various artists who covered or took inspiration from it, continues to impact music today.</span></p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://ptn28.github.io/crosseyed-and-painless/essay-hub.html">Essay Hub</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://ptn28.github.io/crosseyed-and-painless/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://ptn28.github.io/crosseyed-and-painless/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
