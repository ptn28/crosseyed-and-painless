Brog’s “‘Living Turned Inside Out’: The Musical Expression of Psychotic and Schizoid Experience in Talking Heads' </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remain in Light</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” is a journal article which explores how, as a rock album, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remain In</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Light</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an exemplary use of art to depict the human psyche (Brog 2002, 163). Specifically, he examines the songs in the album through a psychoanalytic lens and argues that, despite the incohesive lyrics, the album offers a detailed depiction of psychosis and schizophrenia (178-179). By tying the album’s music to theoretical work on mental disorders, Brog argues that rock music is just as deserving of psychoanalytical study as any other form of art.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a practicing psychiatrist and author of several research papers, Brog positions himself as an expert on psychoanalysis, further backed up by his extensive knowledge of foundational concepts. Examining the lead singer’s proclamation that facts are “sharp as a knife” and “cut a hole in us” in “Crosseyed and Painless”, Brog draws upon the works of Sigmund Freud and Wilfred Bion, whose works are core tenets of psychoanalysis. Brog ties the singer’s antagonism towards facts to Freud’s “observations regarding the psychotic’s hatred of reality” and Bion’s concept of the alpha function, which “converts sensory impressions into elements that can be stored and used for thoughts” (169). Brog argues that the singer’s psychotic breakdown of the alpha function renders facts “undigested” and “irritating physical objects that are best gotten rid of” (169). Referencing the concepts established by influential psychoanalysts, Brog lends credence to his arguments.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Brog’s more literal analysis of the lyrics is quite melodramatic, a common trend throughout the essay but most notable in his discussion of “Born Under Punches” . Describing the singer’s declaration that he is a “tumbler”, Brog argues that the “singer copes with the horror of violent and uncontrolled falls” by attempting to master control over tumbling (167). Here, Brog’s description is hyperbolic and diminishes the credibility of his argument.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Brog analyzes other songs insightfully as a whole, his discussion of  “Born Under Punches” stands out as especially disjointed. Brog argues that Byrne is describing the split personality of the singer, yet his evidence is not logically strung together, switching back and forth between his discussion of the singer’s various self-identifications and the disorienting effects of the music on the listener (167-168). However, some sentences seem to form the beginnings of a cohesive argument. Brog describes how the singer keeps the listener “off balance” through a “sonic assault” of a discordant melody and shouting vocals, linking this to the “projective identification” of the singer's own unstable psyche onto the listener (167). Brog could have had a better argument if he had elaborated on how this revealed the singer’s faltering grip on his two personae; nevertheless, his messy line of reasoning fails to support his original assertion.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Brog excels at highlighting the cultural relevance of his analysis. One of his best rebuttals to the dismissal of rock music by other psychologists is contained within his analysis of “Houses in Motion”, and how it reflects the experiences of schizoids. Brog ties the singer's life of “empty motion [...] without style or grace” to Henry Guntrip’s “description of schizoid experience as one of  ‘mechanized’ [...] apathy,” and his “retreat into a grave” as “strongly reminiscent of the case material that Guntrip used to exemplify schizoid ‘return to the womb’ fantasies” (175). By demonstrating the seamless match between the lyrics of the album to real-world cases subjected to rigorous analysis, Brog demonstrates that rock music has been unjustly neglected.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While psychoanalysts have considered the intersection between medicine and traditional forms of art by subjecting art to formal psychological study, Brog has shown that rock music as a whole is an rich, yet untapped, source of psychoanalytical study. Using </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remain in Light</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the subject of his analysis, Brog argues that rock music deserves the same level of scholarly attention as literature or visual art in psychoanalytic discussion.</span></p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://ptn28.github.io/crosseyed-and-painless/essay-hub.html">Essay Hub</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://ptn28.github.io/crosseyed-and-painless/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://ptn28.github.io/crosseyed-and-painless/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
